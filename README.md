# Medicine-Recommendation-System
## Introduction
#### The Medical Recommendation System is a personalized recommendation engine which uses machine learning to predict possible medical conditions based on symptoms. The system is trained on a dataset of symptoms and diagnoses and uses various classification models to make predictions.

## Technology Used
    Python(3.11.4)
    Streamlit version(1.38.0)
    Jupyter Notebook

## How It Works ?
#### The recommendation system takes symptoms of a disease as input and predicts the disease along with its description. It also provides precautions, medications, workouts, and dietary recommendations to help manage or overcome the disease.



## Algorithm Used
### Random Forest 
### Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

## Benefits

● Personalized Recommendations: It helps doctors choose the best medicines for each patient by looking at their specific health data.

● Saves Time: The system can quickly suggest medications, reducing the time needed to make decisions.

● Better Accuracy: By using data and machine learning, the system can make more accurate medicine suggestions than guessing or using general guidelines.

● Consistency: It ensures the same high-quality recommendations for every patient, regardless of who is using the system.

● Handles More Patients: It can assist with many patients at once, making it ideal for hospitals or clinics with lots of patients.

## Conclusions

#### This recommendation system efficiently predicts diseases and provides comprehensive recommendations for treatment, precautions, diet, and exercises based on user symptoms. It helps in quick diagnosis and offers actionable guidance to users, supporting better health outcomes. ​
